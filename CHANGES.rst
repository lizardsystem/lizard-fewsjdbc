Changelog of lizard-fewsjdbc
============================


2.28 (unreleased)
-----------------

- Move to mapnik 2.2.0.

- Add draw_in_legend option to icon style.

- Changes to datasource.py -- units and labels now work differently.

- Use host specific cache key for multitenancy use.

- Re-added 'add to collage' links. And adjusted the name for the collage
  screen (as the parameter name isn't really needed anymore).

- Added caching for timeseries lookups.

- Added caching for several names that are looked up via queries every single
  time.

- Increased the speed by simply using python's datetime parsing in a smart way
  instead of using the iso8601 library. Observed speed-up of timeseries query
  results: on average 4x!

- Not grabbing unused flag/detection/comment fields anymore.

- Added Douglas-Peucker graph decimation for in-browser speed increases. This
  makes year-long minute data possible.

- Parsing timeseries with regex instead of as xml. This is a big time saver.
  Possible drawback: we depend upon all jdbcs to be correctly configured.

- Using ciso8601 for even quicker datetime parsing. Seems to be 6x faster than
  the pure python datetime parsing (which itself was 4x faster than the the
  iso8601 lib we used before).

- Remove awesome box from threshold template.


2.27 (2013-04-17)
-----------------

- Added an expand() function to datasource.py.


2.26 (2013-04-11)
-----------------

- Let datasource.py return a DataFrame-based timeseries.


2.25 (2013-04-10)
-----------------

- Changed datasource.py because lizard-datasource's 0.7's API changed.


2.24 (2013-03-04)
-----------------

- Removed verify_exists parameter to URLField that gives an exception in
  django 1.5. It has already been deprecated since django 1.3.1


2.23 (2013-02-14)
-----------------

- Fix for unicodedecodeerror regarding parameter names. Clicking on a location
  did not give a result if the parameter had non-7bit-ascii characters in its
  name.


2.22 (2013-02-13)
-----------------

- Add static/lizard_fewsjdbc/jquery.jeditable.mini.js and
  parsley-standalone.min.js to avoid unavailable javascript source issues.

- Add `type="text/javascript"` to above javascript file imports to avoid IE8
  problems.


2.21 (2013-01-28)
-----------------

- Change uggettext to uggettext_lazy in forms.py and models.py to fix
  translation issue.

- Improve test infrastructure.

- PEP8 changes.


2.20 (2013-01-22)
-----------------

- Add end-user customizable color field and default to Threshold model.

- Improve client side form validation.


2.19 (2013-01-21)
-----------------

- Add login-required and permission-required mixins to threshold views.
  Only logged in users that have permission to change thresholds are
  allowed to view/edit/delete thresholds.


2.18 (2013-01-21)
-----------------

- The code for the 'timezone_string' (2.15) didn't work on old
  versions of tzinfo, like those installed on our Ubuntu 11.x web
  servers. Fixed.


2.17 (2013-01-17)
-----------------

- Add model for threshold info that can be used to show custom threshold
  lines on fews objects graphs.

- Add threshold views.


2.16 (2013-01-16)
-----------------

- Added `lizard-fewsjdbc to travis-ci.org
  <https://travis-ci.org/lizardsystem/lizard-fewsjdbc>`_ for automatic testing.

- Change datasource.py so that it can report the current parameter as
  a "unit".


2.15 (2013-01-10)
-----------------

- Add a 'timezone_string' field to a JDBC source that can be used to
  override the timezone information coming from FEWS. Apparently it is
  not that easy to do things correctly in FEWS, and this way timezones
  can be corrected as they enter Lizard.


2.14 (2012-12-19)
-----------------

- Fixed urls.py, so it won't recusively include other lizard-* URLs when
  running as part of a site.


2.13 (2012-12-20)
-----------------

- Added a datasource.py that is used by lizard-datasource. Does not
  affect other code.


2.12 (2012-12-17)
-----------------

- Slightly changed parameter naming related to collage items.

- Add a very much needed timeout to the JDBC proxy query.


2.11 (2012-11-27)
-----------------

- Properly set dependency versions.


2.10 (2012-11-22)
-----------------

- Support mixed flot/matplotlib (IE8) graphs.

- Fix naming of collage items.

- Allow empty location_list queries to support showing a list of ALL locations.


2.9 (2012-10-18)
----------------

- Add caching to layers.py's extent() method.

- Add location search button.


2.8 (2012-10-04)
----------------

- Add support for location searching.

- Some small styling changes.

- Add legend icon.


2.7 (2012-08-23)
----------------

- Fix management command logging.

- Add a parameter name in graphs.


2.6 (2012-07-13)
----------------

- Fixed the management command so it bypasses celery.


2.5 (2012-06-19)
----------------

- Remove old graph.


2.4 (2012-06-07)
----------------

- Added latitude and longitude in locations in the REST API.


2.3 (2012-06-01)
----------------

- Fix some indentation.


2.2 (2012-05-31)
----------------

- Add support for the new FlotGraph.


2.1 (2012-05-29)
----------------

- Fix colorfield reference in migration.


2.0 (2012-05-18)
----------------

- Timeseries are now localized according the a site's settings.

- Fix colorfield import.

- Changing templates to match new layout.

- Added edit link.

- Updated layout for bootstrap.


1.33 (2012-05-15)
-----------------

- Add MANIFEST.in


1.32 (2012-05-15)
-----------------

- Create tasks.py and move fews_jdbc_cache management command to it.


1.31 (2012-03-20)
-----------------

- Removed 'ignore_cache=True' from filter URLs created while the
  ignore cache variable is True. Just that the cache is currently
  being refreshed doesn't mean that the newly cached URLs should
  ignore the cache.

- Fixed bug in fews_jdbc_cache command where it would crash if -d was
  used without an url_name.

1.30 (2012-03-13)
-----------------

- Improved functionality of start_end_dates in the REST API:
  - Removed padding from start and end time
  - 'end' date now gives data up to and including 23:59 on that date

- Added a command to show filters and parameters of a given jdbc
  source.


1.29 (2012-03-12)
-----------------

- Changed the layout and titles of the REST API pages.


1.28 (2012-03-09)
-----------------

- Added two more arguments to the fews_jdbc_cache command:
  -d / --deep : Do a "deep" tree traversal, in the sense that not only
                filters are cached, but parameters and locations too.
  -t / --timeout : Give the duration that values will be kept in the
                   cache, in seconds (the default is currently 8 hours).


1.27 (2012-03-07)
-----------------

- Added optional argument to the fews_jdbc_cache management command.
  Without it, the command creates a filtertree with URLs in it to the
  'lizard_fewsjdbc.jdbc_source' view, but if that's not available the
  command would crash. Give argument 'None' to turn the URLs off, or
  a name to another view.


1.26 (2012-01-17)
-----------------

- Created (the start of) a new REST API using djangorestframework (in
  lizard_fewsjdbc/restapi/).

- Added support for jdbc sources in breadcrumbs

1.25 (2012-01-04)
-----------------

- Hack that seems to fix an issue with location() in layers.py


1.24 (2011-12-21)
-----------------

- Made parameters have the css class 'selected' if they are already
  present in the workspace.


1.23 (2011-12-20)
-----------------

- Made it possible to scale graphs manually.

- Made sure legend is always visible.


1.22 (2011-12-19)
-----------------

- Added parameter and filter names to popup.


1.21 (2011-11-04)
-----------------

- Upgraded to lizard-map 3.3.

- Turned views into class based views, changed templates accordingly.

- Changed buildout.cfg to work with the latest KGS (currently including lizard-ui 3.6, used to be pinned to 2.1.5)

1.20 (2011-09-20)
-----------------

- Raising WorkspaceItemError if the jdbc source doesn't exist. This way,
  existing lizard sessions don't get stuck with an 'error 500' if a jdbc
  source is renamed or removed.


1.19 (2011-09-16)
-----------------

- Fixed timezone bug in Jdbc2Ei and adapted JdbcSource.get_timeseries
  accordingly. https://office.nelen-schuurmans.nl/trac/ticket/3231


1.18 (2011-08-30)
-----------------

- Added adapter_class as an option to the jdbc_source view. This is
  done for reusability of the view.


1.17 (2011-08-17)
-----------------

- Fixed API timeseries request #3156.

- Added version dependency to lizard_map and lizard_ui.

- Added option for admin IconStyles.


1.16 (2011-08-04)
-----------------

- Added min/max/avg/label/horizontal lines to adapter.image function.

- When clicking on a parent filter, the result is now the listing of
  the parameters from filters below. #3029.

- Added IconStyle model and migration. Icons are now configurable. It
  will revert to a default when nothing is configurated.

Note: Clear cache when upgrading to this tag.


1.15 (2011-07-26)
-----------------

- Implemented ignore_cache in get_named_parameters and
  get_parameter_name. Previously the functions ignored the
  ignore_cache parameter.

- Removed force_legend_below and border in adapter.image graph.


1.14 (2011-06-16)
-----------------

- Added try/except in adapter.layer to prevent the function from crashing.


1.13 (2011-06-10)
-----------------

- Showing legend in the graph (plus, the legend is always below the graph).

- Using the location name in the legend.

- Limiting the number of search results to three.


1.12 (2011-06-03)
-----------------

- Depending on lizard-ui > 1.64 as that allows us to not pass along the full
  filter tree when viewing one specific filter item: it saves on the transfer
  time.

- Requiring lizard-map >= 1.80 as we don't have to specify click/hover map
  javascript handlers anymore. And hovering is switched off by default now.

- Removed unused imports.


1.11 (2011-04-21)
-----------------

- Removed unnecessary workspace_manager and date_range_form stuff. It
  is also incompatible with map >= 1.71.


1.10 (2011-03-17)
-----------------

- Corrected faulty migration step (filter_tree_root column was
  inexplicably missing).

- Added south so that the tests also run the migrations, which ensures
  that inexplicably missing migrations at least result in a very
  opinionated reply from the test runner.


1.9.1 (2011-03-10)
------------------

- Added robustness to management fews_jdbc_cache command.


1.9 (2011-03-09)
----------------

- Enabled the 'ignore_cache' option.

- Added management commands to pre-fill cache (user experience boost).

- Added initial migration.


1.8 (2011-02-21)
----------------

- Returning 404s now when there's no data to display for timeseries
  (html, csv, json, png).


1.7 (2011-02-17)
----------------

- Removed mandatory authentication from our experiemental REST api.


1.6 (2011-02-16)
----------------

- When using "period" to select date ranges in the REST api, we count
  from "now" instead of "0:00 today".


1.5 (2011-02-16)
----------------

- Using latest lizard-map with a better date range handling.


1.4 (2011-02-14)
----------------

- Swapped csv emitter for a csv handler: we cannot set the necessary
  response headers in an emitter.


1.3 (2011-02-10)
----------------

- Added sphinx documentation.  (See
  http://doc.lizardsystem.nl/libs/lizard-fewsjdbc/ ).

- Showing parameter name in csv/html column header.

- Making explicit that the extracted datetime is GMT+1.

- Added 'period' parameter: the start/end dates are set to -period
  days till now.


1.2 (2011-02-08)
----------------

- Added height/width support to png api call.


1.1 (2011-02-08)
----------------

- Adding better error handling to jdbc queries: they raise errors
  right away now instead of returning -1 or -2 and checking later on
  in the code.

- Supporting date range setting.

- Added csv/html/png output.

- Added implementation of lizard-map's REST api for jdbc sources,
  filters, parameters and locations.

- Added ``.get_locations()`` method to jdbc source model (with the
  rest of the related get_something methods) instead of keeping it in
  the adapter.

------------------

- Added crumbs_prepend (see lizard_ui).


1.0 (2011-01-13)
----------------

- Fixed not showing all parameters.


0.9.1 (2010-12-08)
------------------

- Bugfix moving operations.


0.9 (2010-12-08)
----------------

- Moved list operations to lizard_map (1.27).

- Added filter_tree_root. The filter_tree_root takes a filter_id as a
  root and loads the tree from that point. Use only if not using
  usecustomfilter.


0.8 (2010-11-10)
----------------

- Bugfix accordion.

- Add tests, make tests independent of external data source.
